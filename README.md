# MMSFE: Multimodal Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement with Contrastive Learning

## Overview
This repository accompanies our research on **Multimodal Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement with Contrastive Learning (MMSFE)**, a framework designed to enhance radiology report generation by integrating multimodal fusion, contrastive learning, and disease-aware prompting. 

ðŸš€ **Paper Status:** The manuscript is currently under review. Full code will be released upon acceptance.

## Features
- **Multimodal Feature Fusion:** Combines knowledge graph-based global features with mask-based local features.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Improves image-text alignment for better report generation.
- **Disease-Aware Prompting:** Guides text generation through adaptive diagnostic prompts.

## Code Release Plan
We aim to provide:
- ðŸ”¹ **Preprocessing scripts** for dataset preparation.
- ðŸ”¹ **Model training and evaluation** code.
- ðŸ”¹ **Pretrained weights** for reproducibility.
- ðŸ”¹ **Colab demo** for easy testing.

ðŸ“¢ Stay tuned for updates!
